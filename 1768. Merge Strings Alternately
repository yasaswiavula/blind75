You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

code: 
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        string = ''
        j = 0
        if word1 == None or word2 == None:
            return -1
        if len(word1)>0 and len(word2)>0:
            for i in word1:
                string += i
                print(string)
                while j<len(word2):
                    string += word2[j]
                    j += 1
                    print(string)
                    break
        if len(word2)>len(word1):
            for i in range(len(word1), len(word2)):
                string += word2[i]
        return(string)

Input
word1 =
"abcd"
word2 =
"pq"
Output
"apbqcd"
Expected
"apbqcd"
